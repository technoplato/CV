I researched open source Android applications that fit our benchmark's needs and modified them to accept input from the command line to run deterministically and automatically.

The list of every application can be found at this Project's URL, however, the applications that I modified are on Github, and those links are below: 

FrozenBubble - the classic, line up the gun and shoot the ball game. Similar to Bejeweled
Link: https://github.com/halfjew22/BenchmarkFrozenBubble

MuPDF - an open source PDF reader:

Offline Wikipedia Viewer - since the simulator does not have internet access, we needed a way to load large amounts of data offline. This was our solution.

Image Loader - we wanted these applications to involve somewhat intensive operations, so we chose to view images.
