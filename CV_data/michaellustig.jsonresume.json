    "summary": "A seasoned software engineer with a diverse technical background and a passion for problem-solving, I have spent years refining my skills across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and web development. I have led multiple teams to success at companies like Prosper Marketplace, Bakkt, and Sam's Club, demonstrating my ability to not only code but also to inspire, manage, and innovate. My experience ranges from co-founding a top-charting Android app, TV Portal, to creating an industry-standard library of shared React components at Prosper. As a lifelong learner, I've leveraged educational platforms like Udacity and Treehouse, not only as a student but also as a teacher, imparting my knowledge on topics like Android development and Firebase. I was one of the select few chosen to attend the Inaugural Android Developer Career Summit by Google in 2015 and have won hackathons such as the XState Orlando Devs in 2023. Beyond coding, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking, and traveling with my wife.",
