    github: https://github.com/technoplato/BeautyTime
    client: Beauty and the Brow
    Dual-Timer Functionality: Created a highly practical dual-timer feature that enables estheticians to manage different treatments independently and simultaneously, greatly improving time efficiency and customer satisfaction.
    User-Friendly Interface: Ensured an easy-to-navigate and intuitive user interface, allowing estheticians to quickly set, monitor, and adjust timings as required for each procedure.
    Note-Taking Feature: Integrated a simple and convenient note-taking system to allow estheticians to jot down important details during treatments, reducing the chances of human error and enhancing treatment precision.
    Data Synchronization: Incorporated real-time data synchronization via Firebase, enabling estheticians to keep their notes and timings updated across multiple devices, facilitating seamless workflow irrespective of their device preference.
    Product-Time Database: Utilized a searchable database that stores distinct time requirements for various products, aiding estheticians in adhering to product-specific instructions and achieving optimal results for clients.

  - name: [WIP] Organic Software
    type: hobby
    role: Hobby Project
    description: I am constructing an iOS SwiftUI application utilizing The Composable Architecture, which transcribes user speech in real-time on-device. This transcription is then sent to a secured server with access to the application's source code. It further processes this transcription through a robust LLM processing pipeline to decipher instructions on potential modifications to the application. The LLM pipeline generates source code adjustments, subsequently crafting a Pull Request that presents proposed changes to the user for additional modification or approval. Once the user confirms the alterations, these changes are seamlessly integrated into the source code and deployed via a CI/CD pipeline. This sophisticated mechanism empowers users to verbally communicate with the software, customizing it to align with their preferences and desired functionality, thereby enhancing user experience and personalization.

      - Firebase
      - Audio Processing
      - git
    description: In a month-long hackathon, conceptualized and developed an innovative, cross-platform audio recognition and transcription system titled "Proof of Listening". The system utilized a myriad of technologies and programming languages to automatically recognize, subtitle, and transcribe any video content, regardless of the hosting platform, enabling users to mint a Solana NFT to proove on-chain that they have listened to the content.
    github: todo
    IPython Notebook Implementation: Developed an IPython Notebook that processed YouTube videos by downloading the audio using yt-dlp.
    Audio Transcription: Utilized and modified a more performant C++ version of OpenAI's Whisper Transcription model, whisper.cpp, to transcribe the audio with above human quality for free.
    Audio Recognition and Cataloging: Associated transcribed audio with sound signatures from the video content and added these to a custom ShazamKit catalog to provide audio recognition capabilities.
    Swift Server and Client Pool Maintenance: Leveraged the Kitura WebSocket library to build a Swift server. Maintained a client pool with their individual WebSocket connections and Shazam Recognition Session.
    Solana NFT Minting: Programmed a Solana smart contract using Rust and the Solana SDK, enabling a dynamic mint price based on-chain metadata stored as a Program Derived Account. Deployed the contract to the Solana testnet which, upon audio recognition, allowed users to mint a Solana NFT as proof of content consumption.
    Proxy Wallet Implementation: Created a "proxy wallet" for Solana using Expo to facilitate quick transactions from the user's phone. This wallet was designed to hold a minimal amount of funds sufficient for transactions, forwarding purchases to the user's primary cryptocurrency wallet.
    Impact and Utility: The system empowered users with automatic recognition and transcription of any video content they're listening to and the capability to mint NFTs as proof of content consumption, adding a new dimension to the digital content consumption experience.
