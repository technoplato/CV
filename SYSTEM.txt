EXAMPLE

Hey Brian, I hope all is well.

I had asked TJ Littlejohn to ping his Network to see if anybody was hiring Senior+ Frontend or Fullstack engineers, and saw that you'd responded so I applied to all of the Frontend, Mobile, and Fullstack positions I saw on Phantom’s Jobs page. 

Just wanted to reach out in hopes that we could chat about what I could offer the team and see if it would be a good fit.

I've got seven years of React, React Native, and Native Mobile experience and have been leading teams for the past two years on building projects to modularize, modernize, and improve our overall code at a couple of different companies.

I participated in the Solana Grizzlython building building “Proof of Listening” - a project that used a custom Solana Program to support dynamic mint pricing and on-chain metadata collection as well as a custom Shazam Catalog to allow users to mint an NFT in order to prove that they listened to the content. This project alone involved a Python pipeline for processing YouTube videos, a Swift Server, a SwiftUI iOS application that streamed microphone data over WebSockets to the Server and a React application to do the same. 

I’ve also had previous experience in writing Android applications in both Kotlin and Java, and helped create the Android Fundamentals course while I work at Google in conjunction with Udacity. 

I remember that your articles were by far the most helpful for learning Solana when I first got into it a couple of years ago, so thanks so much for creating those!

I would love to skill up in Rust and Solana development, but I'm very comfortable in the React, React Native, TypeScript, style-components and React Query stack. In fact, the latest project I'm working on is building a set of shared components to be used across our organization built with styled-components.Thanks in advance for your consideration and I look forward to hopefully getting the opportunity to chat.
